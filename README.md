## File Structure

This [notebook](notebook.html) ([code](notebook.qmd)) keeps track of what is happening where in my scripts:

[Predictor](predictors.html) ([code](predictors.qmd)) and [response](sPlotOpen.html) ([code](sPlotOpen.qmd)) datasets are prepared. In this context, the  [comparability](soil_property_comparison.html) ([code](soil_property_comparison.qmd)) of soil property data gathered by the Exploratorie's Core team and the spatial data source is explored. 

An [explorative data analysis](Hypotheses_on_biodiversity_drivers.html) ([code](Hypotheses_on_biodiversity_drivers.qmd)) was performed based on hypotheses gathered on grassland biodiversity.

A first multivariate [modelling test](modelling_test.html) ([code](modelling_test.qmd)) was performed.
